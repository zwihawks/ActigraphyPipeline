1. Sleep and activity metrics were derived using GGIR (Migueles JH, Rowlands AV, et al.)  
2. Step counts were estimated using open source code (Matthew Patterson, Verisense)  
3. Informal (small n) validity checks on step count estimates were performed by computing MAPE relative to commerically available wearables (Apple Watch, Garmin Forerunner)
